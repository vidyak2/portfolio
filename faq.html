      <h2>What is the process between typing a URL into a browser and the site finishing loading?</h2>

      <section class="span_6_of_6 ">
        <p class="about">On a daily basis, website names are typed into the browser of a device, such as a computer, a tablet, or a phone, and the browser returns the expected website to the user. The process between when the URL is typed and when the loaded site appears seems simple, but consists of many steps. </p>
        <p class="about">Before explaining this process, it is critical to understand the relationship between the client and the server. In this scenario, the client is any device that is connected to the internet. It is important to have an internet connection, since it permits sending and receiving data on the web. The server is the computer that stores websites and apps. These two elements interact in a way that the client sends requests to the server, and the server responds to the needs of the client (MDN web docs, 2017). This is the basis of the process between typing the URL and the website appearing on the screen. However, many other elements and details contribute to this process. At this point, it is important to clarify that the URL is the Uniform Resource Locator. This is the address directly related to a resource on the Web. A single URL is usually linked to a single resource. The resource could be an HTML page, an image, or a CSS document (MDN web docs, 2018).</p>
        <p class="about">The process between typing the URL and the loaded website appearing, can be explained in five steps (MDN web docs, 2017). The first step is typing the web page name into the browser. This name is also called the Domain Name (MDN web docs, 2016).</p>
        <p class="about">The second step is finding the real address of the server on which the website is present, with the help of the Domain Name Server (DNS). The DNS links the address, typed as a string in the browser, to the correct IP address. The IP address is the location on the Web where the page is found, and this is represented by a compilation of numbers.</p>
        <p class="about">The third step is sending an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request message from the browser to the server. This will allow a copy of the website to be given to the client. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol defines the language of communication between the client and the server. These messages are sent through internet connection, using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).</p>
        <p class="about">The fourth step is sending the website files from the server to the browser. This is sent in small pieces, called the data packets.</p>
        <p class="about">The final step is that the browser will put together all the pieces in order, and display the website (MDN web docs, 2017).</p>
